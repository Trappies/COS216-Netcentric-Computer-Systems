1 IMAGE AT A TIME:

Choosing to display one image at a time was a deliberate decision to enhance user focus and provide a better viewing experience. By presenting images individually, users can fully immerse themselves in each image without distractions. It also allows for larger and more detailed images, offering a more enjoyable and engaging experience. Moreover, displaying images sequentially with intuitive navigation controls ensures smooth progression and a sense of control for users.

BASE64:

Opting for Base64 encoding instead of external image links has several benefits. It reduces external dependencies by eliminating the need for separate image files, making the application more self-contained and portable. Base64 encoding improves performance by reducing HTTP requests and enhancing page load times, especially for smaller images or in scenarios with network latency. It simplifies deployment as there's no need to manage and maintain separate image files on a server. Additionally, it ensures data integrity since the image data is embedded directly, preventing broken image links or missing assets.
